A Simple web app to classify Electric guitar models using a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) and transfer learning with Resnet34.

I gather data with the help of fastai library that uses DuckDuckGo by creating a nested list of urls of pictures then download it.

For the purpose of training i turned PNG formatted pictures to JPEG to deal with RGBA issue for training then clear PNG images.
